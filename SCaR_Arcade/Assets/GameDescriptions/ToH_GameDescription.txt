In Towers of Hanoi you have to get all the disks
to the Blue pole. By moving one disk at a time.
While also making sure you don't put a bigger disk
on to a smaller disk.

To move a disk to another pole, simply hold your finger
down on the top disk, and drag to the desired pole. 
If you remove your finger to early, the disk will return to its
original pole.
